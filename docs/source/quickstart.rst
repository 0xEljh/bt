Recommended Setup
-----------------

We believe the best environment to develop with bt is the `IPython Notebook
<http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`__. From their homepage, the IPython Notebook
is:

    "[...] a web-based interactive computational environment
    where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich
    media into a single document [...]"

This environment allows you to plot your charts inline and also allows you to
easily add surrounding text with Markdown. You can easily create Notebooks that
you can share with collegues and you can also save them as PDFs. If you are not
yet convinced, head over to their webpage.

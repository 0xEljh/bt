Installation Guide
===================

The easiest way to install ``bt`` is from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bt/>`_
using ``pip`` or ``easy_insatll``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install bt 

Since bt has many dependencies, we strongly recommend installing the `Anaconda Scientific Python
Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_, especially on Windows. This distribution 
comes with many of the required packages pre-installed, including pip. Once Anaconda is installed, the above 
command should complete the installation. 

bt should be compatible with Python 2.7.
